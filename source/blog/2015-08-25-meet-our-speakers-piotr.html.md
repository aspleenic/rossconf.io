We decided to do short interviews with all of our ROSSConf Berlin speakers, so you can get to know them better. Meet [Piotr Solnica](https://twitter.com/_solnic_), the maintainer of [Ruby Object Mapper](http://rom-rb.org/) - an open-source persistence and mapping toolkit for Ruby.

#### How did you get into Ruby?
I saw Ruby for the first time around 2003 as a couple of plugins for the media player that I used back then were written in Ruby. I thought “looks cool” and learned some basic syntax. Then I started my first job but that was mostly PHP and some Java. Over time I got really tired of PHP and decided to switch to…Python. I started learning it, got pretty far and enjoyed it but then one day my friend asked me “hey, since you’re into web-development, did you check out Ruby on Rails?”. Few months later I started my first job as a ruby/rails developer, that was in 2007.

#### What do you like best about working on Open Source Software? And what do you like least?
I like when somebody finds my projects helpful, this always motivates me a lot. The least favorite part is the constant lack of time to do all the things I’d like to do, especially when it comes to supporting users of my projects.

#### Any side project you are currently working on?
Yes. I decided to write a book about my approach to Ruby and web-development. First step is to build a custom stack built on top of Roda and ROM toolkits.

#### Personal life hack or tool you couldn't do without?
Kanbanflow. It’s an online kanban board with a builtin pomodoro timer. I can’t live without it. I use it to manage my client work, OSS work and various personal todos.  

_You can come hack on Ruby Object Mapper with Piotr at ROSSConf Berlin. [Get your ticket](/event/berlin/#tickets) if you haven't done so yet!_
