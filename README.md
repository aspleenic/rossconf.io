Ruby Open Source Software Vienna
=========
Ruby Open Source Software Vienna (ROSS Vienna) is a one day conference bringing Open Source software maintainers and developers with a heart for outstanding and software together in one room. Or multiple rooms, if need be.  

Four maintainers or main contributors to major Open Source projects will get the chance to recruit highly motivated developers to contribute to their project during the hackathon part of the conference.

ROSS Vienna is a local chapter of the ROSS conference. All ROSS material and resources will be available online, for anyone to use and organise their own local chapter. The logo is an [Open Source project on its own](https://github.com/rossconf/logo/blob/master/README.md).
