Last but not least in our series of interviews with our speakers: Zachary,
who is and has committed to Sinatra, mruby, rails and, the project he will present at ROSS conf Berlin, Ruby.

#### How did you get into Ruby?

I got into Ruby around the time DHH released the Rails blog in 5
minutes video. At the time I was writing PHP and SQL queries by hand,
so this made a huge impression on me.

#### What do you like best about working on Open Source Software? And what do you like least?

My favorite part has to be working with people who have far more
experience than me. I love learning from them every day.

I have to say that my least favorite part is all of the mailing lists
and slack channels I'm apart of, slack is the worst ;)

#### Any side project you are currently working on?

Not sure if I'd call it a side project, but I've been doing a lot of
work on MRuby lately. Really excited to see a compiled Ruby
implementation that's still Just Ruby.

#### Personal life hack or tool you couldn't do without?

Always Be Shipping.
