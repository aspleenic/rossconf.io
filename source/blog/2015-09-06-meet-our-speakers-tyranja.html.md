Next in our interview series with the ROSS conf Berlin speakers: ['tyranja'](https://github.com/tyranja), who works on [the Speakerinnen project](http://speakerinnen.org/) - which aims to increase the visibility and participation of women at (but not limited to) conferences, panels and talk shows.

#### How did you get into Ruby?
I got in Ruby with the help of the Rails Girls I went to the second Rails Girls workshop that was organized in Berlin years ago.

#### What do you like best about working on Open Source Software? And what do you like least?
I like the friendly atmosphere, the political aspect of sharing knowledge and helping each other regardless of their whereabouts. I didn't find anything I don't like yet... Ok,sometimes I don't like that most of the people there seem to have no kids and don't understand the obligation you have with a family.

#### Any side project you are currently working on?
I am also working on [50prozent.speakerinnen.org](http://50prozent.speakerinnen.org) - displaying the percentages of women and men speaking at conferences - and [frauenstudien-muenchen.de](http://www.frauenstudien-muenchen.de/)

#### Personal life hack or tool you couldn't do without?
My collection of useful commands and notes on my computer.
