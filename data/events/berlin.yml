The projects participating in its first edition include exercism.io from Katrina Owen and RVM from Michal Papis. In the morning bit the project owners will introduce their projects and share what would need work in the afternoon hackathon-y part.</p> <p>We ask for a deposit which you will get back upon attendance.</p><p><a class="button" href="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/ross-conf-tickets-16138980124" target="_blank">Register Now!</a></p>'
