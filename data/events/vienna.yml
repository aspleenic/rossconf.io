    description: "[exercism.io](http://exercism.io/) is a platform for practice and crowd-sourced mentorship. The platform delivers exercises in about 20 programming languages. Each exercise consists of a test suite in the target language, and the goal is to make the tests pass, as a starting point for having a conversation about design, idioms, and trade-offs. The conversation leads to iterating on the solution."

It might not always be right, but it will make you think about your design decisions and might just make you a better OOP programmer."
