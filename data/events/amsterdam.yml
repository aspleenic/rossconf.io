description: '<p>ROSS conf Amsterdam gives open source software maintainers the platform to introduce their project to an audience of first time as well as existing contributors. After 15 minute introductions to the project, pressing issues and requests, the conference day is reserved for hands-on programming (or contributing through updating documentation or adding artwork!) and pairing with the maintainers. To conclude the hackathon the maintainers present data on bugs fixed, and pull requests merged.</p>'
