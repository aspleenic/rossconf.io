We're doing (fun) short interviews with all of our ROSS conf Berlin speakers, so you can get to know them better. Today we meet [Laura Frank](https://twitter.com/rhein_wein), working (hard) on [Panamax](http://panamax.io/) - 'Docker Management for humans'.

#### How did you get into Ruby?
My first introduction to Ruby was around 2007 or so -- a couple friends and I were toying with the idea of starting a web consulting group, and I was dabbling around, learning a bit of new stuff. Until then I had really only worked with C++ and Perl (and LOGO!) so needless to say, Ruby left quite an impression. I didn't get paid to write Ruby until about 2010, when I joined an infrastructure engineering team at HP Cloud.

#### What do you like best about working on Open Source Software? And what do you like least?
It's great to see people use software I've written, especially when it helps them do something better, faster, or in a different way. What stinks is never having enough time to dig into all the projects I'd like to. I feel that contributing is an obligation, because OSS has helped me do so many things -- especially when I was just beginning my career.

#### Any side project you are currently working on?
I've been working on an advanced degree in computer science for the last few years. Aside from coursework, you can find me writing small tools to make working with Docker easier.

#### Personal life hack or tool you couldn't do without?
I would be pretty lost without my iPhone (literally!), but I don't know how I'd survive if someone took my git aliases away from me.
